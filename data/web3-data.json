    "bio": "For the past 5 years I have specialized in **Product Design for Decentralization**, focusing on transforming complex Web3 architecture (DeFi, Account Abstraction, DDEs) into smooth, high-adoption consumer UX across mobile, web and spatial computing.\n\nMy career is defined by tackling Web3's hardest challenge - mass adoption.\nI was the Lead Designer who took <a href=\"#\">Gist</a> (Social-fi) from concept to launch, architecting the unique core iOS experience and the UX vision for Apple Vision Pro, which drove 10,000+ waitlist sign-ups.\nSimultaneously, I designed the end-to-end workflow for <a href=\"#\">Chaquen</a> (Game-Fi), implementing Account Abstraction to eliminate wallet friction and scale the platform to 18,000+ active users.\nIn Decentralized Finance (DeFi), I built trust for high-stakes environments, redesigning core flows at <a href=\"#\">Sperax</a> (managing over $10.8 Million TVL) and refining yield/governance UX at <a href=\"#\">Vault Craft</a>.\nBeyond product, I personally build and manage the full design ecosystem, including high-converting waitlist pages and company blogs using <a href=\"#\">Framer</a> and <a href=\"#\">Cursor AI</a>.",
